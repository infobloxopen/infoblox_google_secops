# Infoblox Google SecOps Playbooks

This repository contains the sample playbooks that uses the **Infoblox Threat Defense with DDI** integration in **Google SecOps SOAR** platform to gather intel and perform steps based on this intel.

These automated playbooks can be used as a reference to generate a custom workflow to fulfill your needs.

## Import Playbooks

Importing a playbook into any SecOps instance is a very straight-forward task:

- Download the `.zip` file of the playbook that needs to be imported. This file would also contain all the blocks that are used in the playbook.
  ![Download ZIP](<./screenshots/Download ZIP.png>)

- Open the SecOps instance. From the sidebar, navigate to **Response > Playbooks** section.
  ![Sidebar - Playbooks](<./screenshots/Playbook Section.png>)

- Click on the **three dots** icon at the top of the Playbooks, and then click on **Import**.
  ![Import Playbook](<./screenshots/Import Playbook.png>)

- Select the `.zip` file downloaded earlier.

The playbooks stored in the file would be imported. We can access these under the **Imported Playbooks** folder. These playbooks and blocks can be moved to any other folder of our choice.

You can also download the [All Playbook Bundle](<./All Infoblox Playbooks.zip>) which includes all the Infoblox playbooks and blocks. 

**Important:** Before using any playbook with an alert, review its default settings (triggers, action parameters, etc.) to ensure they align with your needs.

## Playbooks

Playbooks are a feature in Google Security Operations (SecOps) that can be used to automatically perform actions on alerts/cases when triggered. Playbooks can be used to: Retrieve information about alerts, Remediate threats, Create tickets, and Manage toxic combinations and IAM recommendations.

**Points to Note:**

- `.zip` file for every playbook contains the playbook along with all the blocks used in that playbook.
- Each playbook requires a trigger, which decides when the playbook would be run. For some of the playbooks created, the Trigger is set as **All**. Users can update the Trigger conditions based on the requirements.
- As the trigger of every playbook is set to run on all ingested alerts into SecOps instance, the imported playbooks are disabled by default. User can easily enable any playbook by simply cliking on the toggle button beside the playbook name. ([Reference](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/soar/respond/working-with-playbooks/whats-on-the-playbooks-screen#:~:text=At%20the%20top%20segment%20of%20the%20playbook%20designer%20pane%2C%20you%20can%20use%20the%20horizontal%20toggling%20button%20to%20enable%20or%20disable%20the%20playbook.))

### Known Behaviours
- Currently, only the view from the 1st attached playbook will be set for the **Alert Overview** ([Reference](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/SecOps-SOAR/Playbook-Widget-Behavior-in-Alert-Overview/td-p/888644)). For example, if a playbook is already attached to an alert, then the alert overview page will only reflect the view generated by that playbook. Hence, it is advised to enable only the required playbooks. Make sure that the trigger for the playbook is not set to All. Instead, the trigger should be set such that the playbook must only run of relevant set of alerts.


## Troubleshooting

In case of any failures when running any playbook, we can debug the same by running the playbook in the Simulator Mode. For more details, please refer to this guide: [Google SecOps playbooks - Simulator](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/soar/respond/working-with-playbooks/working-with-playbook-simulator).
